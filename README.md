# FetchExercise

I recommend using the IntelliJ IDE to run the script as Maven is bundled with their IDE.

# Project Details

Given a balance scale and 9 gold bars of the same size and look. You donâ€™t know the exact weight of each bar, but you know they all weigh the same, except for one fake bar. It weighs less than others. You need to find the fake gold bar by only bars and balance scales. You can only place gold bars on scale plates (bowls) and find which scale weighs more or less.
This project automates a scaling process to find the fake bar following an algorithm I implemented.
