This is a Maven Project. I recommend using the IntelliJ IDE to run the script as Maven is bundled with their IDE.


## Running the script
1. Import project into IDE.
2. Navigate to the pom.xml
3. Right click on pom.xml and find the Maven option
4. Select 'Reload Project' to update any project dependencies
5. Run the Main project and observe console for output
